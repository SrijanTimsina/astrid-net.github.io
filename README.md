# ChainLink, NFTs and role of Astrid

### What is a Smart Contract? How ChainLink can help them?

When two parties want to reach a certain agreement, they can run into several difficulties: a defaulting party or the cost and the presence of an intermediary. The smart contract is a perfect way to overcome these problems. If we assume that two parties enter into a smart contract, it will be permanently deposited on the blockchain, without any kind of intermediary. If the event for which it was scheduled occurs, it will perform a series of pre-established functions by the two parties. The field of application of this concept is very broad, ranging from insurance to finance.

So Smart Contracts are essentially blocks of conditionally and automatically executing code stored in the Blockchain. They may have conditions that are triggered automatically when a certain value or event is reached. The data that arises from this event can be on-chain (occurs within the blockchain) or off-chain (occurs in the external world). Since smart contracts by their nature are not able to read off-chain data, they need an intermediary who is able to acquire the data from the outside world and translate it into a language understandable by smart contracts.

ChainLink comes has exactly this role. **It's is a decentralized network of nodes that provide data and information from off-blockchain sources to on-blockchain smart contracts via oracles.**

### What is an NFT

We all know that a Blockchain is essentially a ledger in which informations are permanently stored. Transitions on Blockchains that we all know (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) are governed by the presence of a currency that allows you to pay transition fees or reward miners. Within these complex eco-systems it is possible to find Smart Contracts that represent Tokens, i.e. Coins that do not have their own Blockchains but use others to be used and exchanged.

**A particular type of Token are the NFTs, acronym of Not Fungible Token. Unlike traditional tokens, these types of tokens are unique and cannot be exchanged with each other.**                   The concept behind these tokens has huge applications in real life: an NFT can be a work of art, a photograph or a property. This technology would allow to univocally assign the ownership of this tokenizable object to an entity in a safe, effective and fast way.&#x20;

The current trend sees NFTs used to tokenize artworks, luxury goods and characters to be used within metaverses. However, the use cases of NFTs do not end there: soon they will also be used in DeFi protocols, as a collateral. The **introduction of NFTs in DeFi protocols**, in cryptoassets-tracking dApps or in statements of particular smart contracts, **will soon make it important to have an estimate of the value of an NFT. Here starts the role of Andromeda.**

### Astrid role

We have seen in the next future the estimated price of an NFT could be one of the most needed data. However, the estimation of this kind of tokens is really hard to do. In the world of blockchains all types of assets with the exception of NFTs are simple, as it is possible to sell the amount of coins you own in real time, instead the estimate of a non-fungible token is much more similar to that of a property: you need to look for a buyer to purchase your NFT. So it will be necessary to somehow identify the minimum price that a user is willing to pay for it.

Since this is an extremely random variable, **the Andromeda team has considered over 15 events influencing the price of an NFT and developed a Machine Learning model that allows to obtain the estimate of the value of an NFT with a rather high accuracy score**. The details of the team's research will be covered in the following chapter.
